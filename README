I am sick of the fragmentation of GNU-screen packages in Arch Linux.
The official package is based on the 3-year-old 4.0.3 release and has 
only a few patches and no vertical split. There are screen-vs and screen-git 
in AUR, neither of which has the long-TERM patch to support people with 
rxvt-unicode-256colors. I am just going to make my own and use this from now on!

This uses latest code from the official screen git repo. Updates are sparse these 
days, so you won't have to rebuild much. To quickly check for recent updates:
