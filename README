I am sick of the fragmentation of GNU-screen packages in Arch Linux.
The official package is based on the 3-year-old 4.0.3 release and has 
only a few patches and no vertical split. There are screen-vs and screen-git 
in AUR, neither of which has the long-TERM patch to support people with 
rxvt-unicode-256colors. I am just going to make my own and use this from now on!
